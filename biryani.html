            Layer half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken.
            Sprinkle half of the chopped mint and coriander leaves, and place the green chilies on top.
            Layer the remaining rice on top of the herbs.
            Drizzle saffron-infused milk over the rice for an aromatic touch.
            Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam.</li>
            <ul>
